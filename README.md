# Loan's Approval Prediction 

- Implement a classification model to predict whether or not a loan application is approved using **Neural Networks**


# Steps

1. Loading the dataset into pandas dataframe
2. Cleaning and pre-processing data
3. One hot encoding categorical features into numeric
4. Creating training and validation set
5. Defining the architeture of the model
6. Compiling the model (defining loss/cost function, optimizer)
7. Training the model
8. Evaluating model performance on both training and validation set

# Requirements:

## Softwares:

- Python >= 3.7
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- Keras
- Tensor Flow
