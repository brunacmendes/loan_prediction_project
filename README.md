# Loan's Approval Prediction 

- Implement a classification model to predict whether or not a loan application is approved using **Neural Networks**


# Steps

1. Loading the dataset into pandas dataframe
2. One hot encoding categorical features into numeric
3. Creating training and validation set
4. Defining the architeture of the model
5. Compiling the model (defining loss/cost function, optimizer)
6. Training the model
7. Evaluating model performance on both training and validation set

# Requirements:

## Softwares:

- Python >= 3.7
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- Keras
- Tensor Flow
